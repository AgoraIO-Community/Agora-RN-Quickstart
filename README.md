Use this guide to quickly start a multiple user group call.

The source code of Agora React Native SDK can be found [Here](https://github.com/syanbo/react-native-agora), [API doc](https://syanbo.github.io/react-native-agora/globals.html).

├── ios
├── App.tsx
├── index.js
.
```

### Generate an App ID

In the next step, you need to use the App ID of your project. Follow these steps to [Create an Agora project](https://docs.agora.io/en/Agora%20Platform/manage_projects?platform=All%20Platformshttps://docs.agora.io/en/Agora%20Platform/manage_projects?platform=All%20Platforms#create-a-new-project) in Console and get an [App ID](https://docs.agora.io/en/Agora%20Platform/terms?platform=All%20Platforms#a-nameappidaapp-id).

1. Go to [Console](https://dashboard.agora.io/) and click the [Project Management](https://dashboard.agora.io/projects) icon on the left navigation panel. 
2. Click **Create** and follow the on-screen instructions to set the project name, choose an authentication mechanism (for this project select App ID without a certificate), and Click **Submit**. 
3. On the **Project Management** page, find the **App ID** of your project. 

Check the end of document if you want to use App ID with the certificate.

### Steps to run our example

* Download and extract the zip file.
* Run `npm install` to install the app dependencies in the unzipped directory.
* Navigate to `./App.tsx` and enter your App ID and token that we generated as `appId: 'YourAppId', token: 'YourChannelToken'`
* Open a terminal and execute `cd ios && pod install`.
* Connect your device and run `npx react-native run-android` or `npx react-native run-ios` to start the app.

The app uses `channel-x` as the channel name.
